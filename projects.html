              <li>
                Uses ChatGPT3.5 and LangChain to extract structured data from
                text and decompose the problem into smaller tasks.

              <!-- <li>
                I had taken the "LangChain for LLM Application Development",
                "LangChain Chat with your Data", and "Functions, Tools and
                Agents with LangChain" courses offered by DeepLearning.AI and
                wanted to build an app of my own.

                What I learned: Prompting was very important for working with
                the pre-trained ChatGPT3.5 model. I was surprised by how fragile
                the model was to slight changes in prompts (even with temp=0). I
                did a lot of prompt engineering and tinkering with agents vs.
                sequential chains, more freedom vs. constrained outputs. For
                example, I tried giving an agent a task and math tools to do
                calculations, and it would make unnecessary tool calls and
                ultimately fail at the task. It's currently using a simple
                sequential chain of prompts to fill in a table to the best of
                the chain's ability (without math tools), and letting the human
                edit the table on the frontend.
